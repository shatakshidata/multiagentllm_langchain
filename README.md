# Multi-Agent LLM Project

A minimal multi-agent system powered by LangChain and large language models (LLMs). This repository demonstrates how to generate **synthetic data**, visualize insights, and optionally integrate a **knowledge retriever** for more grounded responsesâ€”all orchestrated by a central AI agent.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Dynamically creates mock datasets for testing or simulation.  
- **Visualization**: Produces basic plots or dashboards to illustrate insights.  
- **Knowledge Retrieval (Optional)**: Uses a vector store to provide factual grounding.  
- **LangChain Orchestrator**: A single agent to coordinate tasks among sub-agents/tools.  
- **(Optional) LangSmith Integration**: Automatic logging and debugging of your AI chain runs.
